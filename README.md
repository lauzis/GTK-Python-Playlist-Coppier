# Why this project exists
In the dark ages when there was no spotify, was using Rhytmbox player to play song from private music library, and had several playlists.
Sometimes copied files to phone, or to usb flash to get my favorite songs playable on the go. So there was trouble of searching trough several directories and finding the files.
So decided to create this small application, that takes the Rhytmbox playlist in and coppies all the selected audio files to given directory.
